# Sprinkler Interface
Automatic sprinkler systems have terrible controls. We'll make a smart controller that will run a spinkler program for ~6 zones according to a day-of-the-week timer, with automatic adjustments made for recent weather data (fetched from the web). Ideally it'll have a web interface. Hardware requirements: Arduino board with wifi... ~$200. OpenSprinkler is an open source project that does this (not sure what their hardware is)... ideally we'd start from scratch, but we could look at what they did for guidance. I have a need for such a system at my house.

# Smart Thermostat
Like the Nest, but this one we'd build. This one would need an Arduino also. I'm very unsatisfied with my current thermostat.

# Legal Form Filler-outer
This idea came from a group I volunteer with. Attorneys volunteer their time (typically 4 hours at a time) and spend about half of it filling in redundant information on 4-7 legal documents: full names, addresses, case numbers, kids names and birthdays.... If we made a web-interfacing database that could autofill this information, we could save the attorneys a lot of time. Currently the forms are available in .pdf and Word... I'm not sure what the best output format would be, or the easiest way to go about this... but since printing any web document to pdf is easy, we should have some different options.

# Web-based Workout Log
I'm sure there are a bunch out there already, but this is something I've wanted to do for a while. It should be able to log sets/reps/weights as you work out, and compare results to previous efforts and PRs.

# Contribute to an existing GitHub open source project
I haven't done a whole lot of looking, but there are lots out there...
